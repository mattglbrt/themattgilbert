# Summary
Find Your Why is a practical guide that helps individuals and organizations identify their purpose and create a fulfilling and inspiring career or business. The book builds on Sinek's previous work on leadership and business, particularly his concept of the "Golden Circle" which emphasizes starting with why.

In "Find Your Why," Sinek and his co-authors, David Mead and Peter Docker, provide a step-by-step process for discovering your personal or organizational "why," defined as your reason for existence beyond making money or achieving success. The book's process involves three main steps:

1. Discovering your individual or collective strengths, values, and experiences.
2. Identifying the impact you want to make in the world.
3. Crafting a compelling why statement that can guide your decision-making and inspire others to join your cause.

Throughout the book, Sinek and his co-authors provide real-world examples of individuals and organizations that have found their why and achieved success and fulfillment. They also address common challenges and obstacles that can arise while finding your why and offer practical tips and strategies for overcoming them.

Overall, "Find Your Why" is a practical and inspiring guide for anyone who wants to live a purpose-driven life or create a purpose-driven organization. It emphasizes the importance of starting with why and provides a clear and actionable process for discovering and living your purpose.

# How to Find Your Why
1. **Reflect on your life experiences:** Start by reflecting on your life experiences and identifying the moments when you felt most fulfilled, energized, and alive. Consider the activities or experiences that brought you the most joy, pride, and a sense of accomplishment.

2. **Identify your values:** Think about the values that guide your life and decision-making. What do you believe in? What principles or beliefs are most important to you? Write down your values and rank them in order of importance.

3. **Determine your strengths:** Identify your unique strengths and talents. What are you naturally good at? What do people often come to you for help with? Reflect on the feedback you've received from others and consider taking a strengths assessment to gain more insight.

4. **Discover your passion:** Identify the things that make you feel most passionate and alive. What topics or causes do you care deeply about? What problems do you want to solve? Consider your hobbies, interests, and the topics you often research in your free time.

5. **Determine your contribution:** Think about the impact you want to make in the world. What problems do you want to solve? How do you want to help others? What do you want to be known for? Identify your desired contribution and the impact you want to have on the world.

6. **Craft your why statement:** Use the insights from the previous steps to craft a compelling why statement that reflects your purpose, values, strengths, passion, and contribution. Your why statement should be simple, clear, and inspiring, and it should answer the question "why do you do what you do?"

7. **Share your why with others:** Once you've crafted your why statement, share it with others. Your why statement can help you attract like-minded people and inspire others to join your cause. It can also serve as a guide for decision-making and help you stay focused on your purpose.

8. **Live your why:** Finally, commit to living your why every day. Use your why statement as a guide for decision-making and take actions that align with your purpose, values, and contribution. Remember that finding your why is just the beginning - living your why is a lifelong journey.

# My Raw, Personal Notes
A why statement should be "to 'action' so that 'contribution'."
## It must be statement of value for both work and friends and family. Everlasting. Not a product or service it's the underlying motive behind everything you do. 

When we work with a clear why in our mind we show up everyday with purpose. 

Find memories and experiences from past that create your gut feelings. 

Gather stories, share stories, find your themes. Craft your why.

The why is your origin story. 

I enjoy creating and solving problems. Using my brain and figuring out hard shit that ther people have a hard time with. What are my earliest memories where I felt pride?
Winning awards from afterschool, I strangely don't feel pride from all the soccer awards. Getting priase at work. Teaching classes. Making sales, and having a good sales meeting, closing the deal. I'm trying to look back and think about it and I am having a hard time actually thinking of times that filled me with pride. Has that been my problem all along? 

My sense of identiy and pride has come from being able to figure things out, always find a solution. Learning new things. What is my why?

Why are people friends with me? I have been naturally a leader, honesty and self sufficiency are what drive me personally. Not being beholden to anyone, but through this I feel a sense of being beholden to help people and follow through on the things that I say I will do and to consistenly show up. My entire career has been building for other people and creating their dreams and helping them acheive them. 

What is my why. To create so that others can do the same?

Is that enough?

I constantly learn and create myself so that I can help as many people as possible create and build their ideal lives and businesses.

I am a builder. 

I am a creator.

Why do i build, why do i create. I think that is the divine in humans and that all humans exist to create. Created to create. 

I beleive that that all humans are here to create. Whether it is art, stories, businesses, I am here to help you do that. I am here to help you create more, better, and share it with the world 

It's not enough to just create, it must be shared with the world so that it can have a compounded effect of inspriation and motivation to others. That is my why.

I create and build so that I can help others do the same.
