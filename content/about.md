Over the last 12 years I have led agencies, corporations, and startups in roles such as Director of Marketing, Director of Growth, Director of Sales, and Director of Global Demand Generation.

I have helped e-commerce stores go from $0 to their first million. I have helped startups go from conceptualization to acquisition, and I have managed demand generation for enterprise companies making over $200 Million a year.

I have helped 100s of businesses across all stages of growth reach their goals and increase sales.
