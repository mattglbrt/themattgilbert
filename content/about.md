# Now
## April 2023 - Focusing on the next phase.
I'm on the cusp of the next phase of my life, and I want to hone in on what exactly that will be. I've spent the last year in a wild blur trying to keep my head above water while building my businesses and consulting career and now I feel like it is time I start intentionally propelling myself forward into what I am meant to be doing.
# Matt Gilbert's Bio
Matt Gilbert is a husband, father, artist, maker, writer, and consultant. On some days he is also a gardener, leather worker, developer or just a blob attached to a keyboard and chair. He's working on that last one every day.

He currently live in Chesapeake, VA with my wife, daughter, and son. They share their home with two German Shepherds and a feral beast some people might mistake for a cat.
